# Insights-from-Failed-Orders
I conducted an analysis of clients activity data on an online application in order to get insights from failed orders. I built up distribution of orders according to reasons for failure: cancellations before and after driver assignment, and reasons for order rejection. I analyzed the resulting plot to see the highest number of orders. I plotted the distribution of failed orders by hours to see if there is a trend that certain hours have an abnormally high proportion of one category or another. I plotted the average time to cancellation with and without driver, by the hour. I analyzed if there are any outliers in the data to remove them in order to draw better conclusions from this plot. Finally, I plotted the distribution of average ETA by hours. This project was completed using Python: Python3 (numpy, pandas)
